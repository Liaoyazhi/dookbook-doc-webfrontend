# Gecko

**Gecko** is the layout engine developed by the Mozilla Project and used in many apps/devices,
including Firefox and Firefox OS.

Web browsers need software called a layout engine to interpret HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and embedded
content (like images) and draw everything to your screen. Besides this, Gecko makes sure associated
APIs work well on every operating system Gecko supports, and that appropriate APIs are exposed only
to relevant support targets. This means that Gecko includes, among other things, a networking stack,
graphics stack, layout engine, a JavaScript virtual machine, and porting layers.

Since all Firefox OS apps are Web apps, Firefox OS uses Gecko as its app runtime as well.
