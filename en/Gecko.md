# Gecko

**Gecko** is the **layout engine** developed by the *Mozilla Project* and used in many apps/devices,
including *[Firefox](/en/glossary/Mozilla_FireFox)* and *Firefox OS*.

*[[Web browser]]s* need software called a layout engine to interpret [[HTML]], [[CSS]],
[[JavaScript]], and embedded content (like images) and draw everything to your screen. Besides this,
Gecko makes sure associated APIs work well on every operating system Gecko supports, and that
appropriate APIs are exposed only to relevant support targets. This means that Gecko includes, among
other things, a networking stack, graphics stack, layout engine, a [[JavaScript]] virtual machine, and
porting layers.

Since all Firefox OS apps are Web apps, Firefox OS uses Gecko as its app runtime as well.
