## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `for` | A space-separated list of other elementsâ€™ `id`s, indicating that those elements contributed input values to (or otherwise affected) the calculation.
| `form` | The form element that this element is associated with (its "form owner"). The value of the attribute must be the id of a [`<form>`](/en/webfrontend/<form>) element in the same document. This attribute is not needed if the `<output>` element is a descendant of a [`<form>`](/en/webfrontend/<form>) element (in which case that form is the form owner), or if the `<output>` element isn't associated with a form at all.
| `name` | The element's name; used to identify this `<output>` during form submission.

## Example

This form provides a slider whose value can range between 0 and 100. and an [`<input>`](/en/webfrontend/<input>)
element into which you can enter a second number. The two numbers are added together and the result is
displayed in the `<output>` element each time the value of any of the controls changes.

```html
<form oninput="result.value=parseInt(a.value)+parseInt(b.value)">
  <input type="range" name="b" value="50" /> +
  <input type="number" name="a" value="10" /> =
  <output name="result">60</output>
</form>
```
