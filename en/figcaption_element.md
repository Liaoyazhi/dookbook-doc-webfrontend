## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

## `<figure>`

The HTML `<figure>` (Figure With Optional Caption) element represents self-contained content,
potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the (`<figcaption>`) element. The figure,
its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.

## Usage Notes

- Usually a `<figure>` is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced
in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an
appendix without affecting the main flow.
- Being a sectioning root, the outline of the content of the `<figure>` element is excluded
from the main outline of the document.
- A caption can be associated with the `<figure>` element by inserting a `<figcaption>` inside it
(as the first or the last child). The first `<figcaption>` element found
in the figure is presented as the figure's caption.

### Poems

```html
<figure>
  <p style="white-space:pre;">
Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,
  Or like a fairy trip upon the green,
Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,
  Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
  Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</p>
  <figcaption><cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>,
    by William Shakespeare</figcaption>
</figure>
