## `Array.push()`

The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of
the array.

## Syntax

```javascript
arr.push(element1[, ...[, elementN]])
```

| parameter | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `elementN` | The elements to add to the end of the array. |

**Return value**: The new `length` property of the object upon which the method was called.

## Description

The `push` method appends values to an array.

`push` is intentionally generic. This method can be used with [`call()`](/en/webfrontend/Function.call)
or [`apply()`](/en/webfrontend/Function.apply) on objects resembling arrays. The `push` method
relies on a `length` property to determine where to start inserting the given values. If the length
property cannot be converted into a number, the index used is 0. This includes the possibility of
`length` being nonexistent, in which case `length` will also be created.

Although [strings](/en/webfrontend/String) are native, Array-like objects, they are not
suitable in applications of this
method, as strings are immutable.  Similarly for the native, Array-like object arguments.

## Examples

### Adding elements to an array

The following code creates the `sports` array containing two elements, then appends two elements to
it. The `total` variable contains the new length of the array.

```javascript
var sports = ['soccer', 'baseball'];
var total = sports.push('football', 'swimming');

console.log(sports); // ['soccer', 'baseball', 'football', 'swimming']
console.log(total);  // 4
```

### Merging two arrays

This example uses [`apply()`](/en/webfrontend/Function.apply) to `push` all elements from a
second array.

Do not use this method if the second array (`moreVegs` in the example) is very large, because the
maximum number of parameters that one function can take is limited in practice. See
[`apply()`](/en/webfrontend/Function.apply) for more details.

```javascript
var vegetables = ['parsnip', 'potato'];
var moreVegs = ['celery', 'beetroot'];

// Merge the second array into the first one
// Equivalent to vegetables.push('celery', 'beetroot');
Array.push.apply(vegetables, moreVegs);

console.log(vegetables); // ['parsnip', 'potato', 'celery', 'beetroot']
```

### Using an object in an array-like fashion

As mentioned above, `push` is intentionally generic, and we can use that to our advantage. `Array.push`
can work on an object just fine, as this example shows. Note that we don't create an array to store
a collection of objects. Instead, we store the collection on the object itself and use `call` on
`Array.push` to trick the method into thinking we are dealing with an array, and it just
works, thanks to the way JavaScript allows us to establish the execution context however we please.

```javascript
var obj = {
    length: 0,

    addElem: function addElem(elem) {
        // obj.length is automatically incremented
        // every time an element is added.
        [].push.call(this, elem);
    }
};

// Let's add some empty objects just to illustrate.
obj.addElem({});
obj.addElem({});
console.log(obj.length);
// â†’ 2
```

Note that although `obj` is not an array, the method `push` successfully incremented `obj`'s `length`
property just like if we were dealing with an actual array.
