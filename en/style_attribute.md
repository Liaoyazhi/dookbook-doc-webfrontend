# HTML Global Attribute: `style`

The **`style`** [global attribute](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes) contains CSS styling
declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a
separate file or files. This attribute and the [`<style>`](/en/webfrontend/<style>) element have
mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling, for example for testing purposes.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    **Usage note**: This attribute must not be used to convey semantic information. Even if all styling
    is removed, a page should remain semantically correct. Typically it shouldn't be used to hide
    irrelevant information; this should be done using the [`hidden`](/en/webfrontend/hidden_attribute)
    attribute.
