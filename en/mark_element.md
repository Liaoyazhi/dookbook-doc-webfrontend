# `<mark>`

The **HTML Mark Text element (`<mark>`)** represents text which is marked or highlighted for
reference or notation purposes, due to the marked passage's relevance or
importance in the enclosing context.

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Content categories** | Flow content, phrasing content, palpable content.|
| **Permitted content** | Phrasing content.|
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.|
| **Permitted parents** | Any element that accepts phrasing content.|
| **Permitted ARIA roles** | Any |
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLElement` |

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

## Usage Notes

Typical use cases for `<mark>` include:

- When used in a quotation ([`<q>`](/en/webfrontend/<q>)) or block quote ([`<blockquote>`](/en/webfrontend/<blockquote>)),
it generally indicates text which is of special interest but is not marked in the original source material,
or material which needs special scrutiny even though the original author didn't think it was of
particular importance. Think of this like using a highlighter pen in a book to
mark passages that you find of interest.
- Otherwise, `<mark>` indicates a portion of the document's content which is likely to be relevant
to the user's current activity. This might be used, for example, to indicate the
words that matched a search operation.
- Don't use `<mark>` for syntax highlighting purposes; instead, use the
[`<span>`](/en/webfrontend/<span>) element with appropriate CSS applied to it.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Don't confuse `<mark>` with the [`<strong>`](/en/webfrontend/<strong>) element; `<mark>` is used
    to denote content which has a degree of relevance, while [`<strong>`](/en/webfrontend/<strong>)
    indicates spans of text of importance.

## Examples

### Marking text of interest

In this first example, a `<mark>` element is used to mark some text within a quote
which is of particular interest to the user.

```html
<blockquote>
  It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a
  hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil
  Galactic Empire. During the battle, <mark>Rebel spies managed
  to steal secret plans</mark> to the Empire’s ultimate weapon,
  the DEATH STAR, an armored space station with enough power to
  destroy an entire planet.
</blockquote>
```

### Identifying context-sensitive passages

This example demonstrates using `<mark>` to mark search results within a passage.

```html
<p>It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death
Star has been destroyed, <mark class="match">Imperial</mark>
troops have driven the Rebel forces from their hidden base and
pursued them across the galaxy.</p>

<p>Evading the dreaded <mark class="match">Imperial</mark>
Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker
has established a new secret base on the remote ice world of
Hoth.</p>
```

To help distinguish the use of `<mark>` for search results from other potential usage, this example
applies the custom class "match" to each match.

## Accessibility Concerns

The presence of the `mark` element is not announced by most screen reading technology in its default
configuration. It can be made to be announced by using the CSS `content` property, along with
the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.

```css
mark::before,
mark::after {
  clip-path: inset(100%);
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}

mark::before {
  content: " highlight start] ";
}

mark::after {
  content: " highlight end] ";
}
```

Some people who use screen readers deliberately disable announcing content that creates extra
verbosity. Because of this, it is important to not abuse this technique and only apply it in
situations where not knowing content has been highlighted would adversely affect understanding.
