# `<small>`

The **HTML `<small>` element** makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large
to medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum font size.  In HTML5, this
element is repurposed to represent side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal text,
independent of its styled presentation.

    **Implementation note:** up to Gecko 1.9.2 inclusive, Firefox implements the
    `HTMLSpanElement` interface for this element.

## Examples

### Example 1

```html
<p>This is the first sentence. <small>This whole sentence
  is in small letters.</small></p>
```

### Example 2 (CSS alternative)

```html
<p>This is the first sentence.
  <span style="font-size:0.8em;">This whole sentence is in small
  letters.</span></p>
```

## Notes

Although the `<small>` element, like the [`<b>`](/en/webfrontend/<b>) and
[`<i>`](/en/webfrontend/<i>) elements, may be perceived to violate the principle of separation
between structure and presentation, all three are valid in HTML5. Authors are encouraged to use
their best judgement when determining whether to use `<small>` or CSS.
