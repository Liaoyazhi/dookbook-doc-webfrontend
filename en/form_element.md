# `<form>`

The **HTML `<form>` element** represents a document section that contains interactive controls for
submitting information to a web server.

It is possible to use the `:valid` and `:invalid` CSS pseudo-classes to style a `<form>`
element based on whether or not the individual `elements` within the form are valid.

|  |  |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Content categories** | Flow content, palpable content |
| **Permitted content** | Flow content, but not containing `<form>` elements|
| **Tag omission** | None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory. |
| **Permitted parents** | Any element that accepts flow content |
| **Permitted ARIA roles** | `group`, `presentation` |
| **DOM interface** | `HTMLFormElement` |

**Attributes**:

This element includes the [global attributes](/en/webfrontend/HTML_Global_Attributes).

| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `accept-charset` | A space- or comma-delimited list of character encodings that the server accepts. The browser uses them in the order in which they are listed. The default value, the reserved string `"UNKNOWN"`, indicates the same encoding as that of the document containing the form element. <br>In previous versions of HTML, the different character encodings could be delimited by spaces or commas. In HTML5, only spaces are allowed as delimiters.
| `action` | The URI of a program that processes the form information. This value can be overridden by a formaction attribute on a [`<button>`](/en/webfrontend/<button>) or `<input>` element.
| `autocapitalize` | This is a nonstandard attribute used by iOS Safari Mobile which controls whether and how the text value for textual form control descendants should be automatically capitalized as it is entered/edited by the user. If the `autocapitalize` attribute is specified on an individual form control descendant, it trumps the form-wide `autocapitalize` setting. The non-deprecated values are available in iOS 5 and later. The default value is `sentences`. Possible values are:<br>`none`: Completely disables automatic capitalization<br>`sentences`: Automatically capitalize the first letter of sentences.<br>`words`: Automatically capitalize the first letter of words.<br>`characters`: Automatically capitalize all characters.
| `autocomplete` |Indicates whether input elements can by default have their values automatically completed by the browser. This setting can be overridden by an `autocomplete` attribute on an element belonging to the form. Possible values are:<br>`off`: The user must explicitly enter a value into each field for every use, or the document provides its own auto-completion method; the browser does not automatically complete entries.<br>`on`: The browser can automatically complete values based on values that the user has previously entered in the form.<br><br>For most modern browsers (including Firefox 38+, Google Chrome 34+, IE 11+) setting the autocomplete attribute will not prevent a browser's password manager from asking the user if they want to store login fields (username and password), if the user permits the storage the browser will autofill the login the next time the user visits the page. See The autocomplete attribute and login fields.<br>**Note:** If you set `autocomplete` to `off` in a form because the document provides its own auto-completion, then you should also set `autocomplete` to `off` for each of the form's `input` elements that the document can auto-complete. For details, see the note regarding Google Chrome in the Browser Compatibility chart.
| `enctype` | When the value of the `method` attribute is `post`, enctype is the [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime_type) of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:<br>`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: The default value if the attribute is not specified.<br>`multipart/form-data`: The value used for an `<input>` element with the `type` attribute set to "file".<br>`text/plain`: (HTML5) This value can be overridden by a formenctype attribute on a [`<button>`](/en/webfrontend/<button>) or `<input>` element.
| `method` | The HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:<br>`post`: Corresponds to the HTTP [POST method](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.5); form data are included in the body of the form and sent to the server.<br>`get`: Corresponds to the HTTP [GET method](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.3); form data are appended to the action attribute URI with a '?' as separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII characters.<br>`dialog`: Use when the form is inside a [`<dialog>`](/en/webfrontend/<dialog>) element to close the dialog when submitted.<br><br>This value can be overridden by a `formmethod` attribute on a [`<button>`](/en/webfrontend/<button>) or `<input>` element.
| `name` | The name of the form. In HTML 4, its use is deprecated (id should be used instead). It must be unique among the forms in a document and not just an empty string in HTML 5.
| `novalidate` | This Boolean attribute indicates that the form is not to be validated when submitted. If this attribute is not specified (and therefore the form is validated), this default setting can be overridden by a `formnovalidate` attribute on a [`<button>`](/en/webfrontend/<button>) or `<input>` element belonging to the form.
| `target` | A name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. In HTML 4, this is the name/keyword for a frame. In HTML5, it is a name/keyword for a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). The following keywords have special meanings:<br>`_self`:  Load the response into the same HTML 4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified.<br>`_blank`: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML 4 window or HTML5 browsing context.<br>`_parent`: Load the response into the HTML 4 frameset parent of the current frame, or HTML5 parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.<br>`_top`: HTML 4: Load the response into the full original window, and cancel all other frames. HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (i.e., the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.<br>`iframename`: The response is displayed in a named [`<iframe>`](/en/webfrontend/<iframe>).<br><br>HTML5: This value can be overridden by a formtarget attribute on a [`<button>`](/en/webfrontend/<button>) or `<input>` element.

## `<input>`

The **HTML `<input>` element** is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order
to accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available,
depending on the device and user agent.

### Form `<input>` types

How an `<input>` works varies considerably depending on the value of its `type` attribute,
hence the different types are covered in their own separate reference pages.
If this attribute is not specified, the default type adopted is `text`.

The available types are as follows:

- `button`: A push button with no default behavior.
- `checkbox`: A check box allowing single values to be selected/deselected.
- `color`: A control for specifying a color. A color picker's UI has no required features
other than accepting simple colors as text (more info).
- `date`: A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time).
- `datetime-local`: A control for entering a date and time, with no time zone.
- `email`: A field for editing an e-mail address.
- `file`: A control that lets the user select a file. Use the **accept** attribute to define
the types of files that the control can select.
- `hidden`: A control that is not displayed but whose value is submitted to the server.
- `image`: A graphical submit button. You must use the **src** attribute to define the
source of the image and the **alt** attribute to define alternative text. You can use the **height**
and **width** attributes to define the size of the image in pixels.
- `month`: A control for entering a month and year, with no time zone.
- `number`: A control for entering a number.
- `password`: A single-line text field whose value is obscured. Use the **maxlength** and
**minlength** attributes to specify the maximum length of the value that can be entered.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: Any forms involving sensitive information like passwords (e.g. login forms) should be
    served over HTTPS; Firefox now implements multiple mechanisms to warn against insecure login
    forms — see Insecure passwords. Other browsers are also implementing similar mechanisms.

- `radio`: A radio button, allowing a single value to be selected out of multiple choices.
- `range`: A control for entering a number whose exact value is not important.
- `reset`: A button that resets the contents of the form to default values.
- `search`: A single-line text field for entering search strings.
Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value.
- `submit`: A button that submits the form.
- `tel`: A control for entering a telephone number.
- `text`: A single-line text field. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value.
- `time`: A control for entering a time value with no time zone.
- `url`: A field for entering a URL.
- `week`: A control for entering a date consisting of a week-year number and a
week number with no time zone.

### Attributes

The `<input>` element is one of the most powerful and complex in all of HTML due to the sheer number
of combinations of input types and attributes. Since every `<input>` element, regardless of type,
is based on the HTMLInputElement interface, they technically all share the exact same set of
attributes. However, in reality, many attributes only function on specific input types, and some
input types support very few of these attributes. In addition,
some input types handle certain attributes in special ways.

Here, you'll find information about the individual attributes which are common to all
`<input>` element types, as well as a few non-standard attributes that may be worth knowing about.

**Attributes common to all input types**:

This section lists the attributes which are used by all form `<input>` types. Attributes that are
unique to particular input types—or attributes which are common to all input types but have special
behaviors when used on a given input type—are instead documented on those types' pages.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: This includes the global HTML attributes.

| Attribute | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `autocomplete` | A string indicating the type of autocomplete functionality, if any, to allow on the input
| `autofocus` | A Boolean which, if present, makes the input take focus when the form is presented
| `disabled` | A Boolean attribute which is present if the input should be disabled
| `form` | The id of the `<form>` of which the input is a member; if absent, the input is a member of the nearest containing form, or is not a member of a form at all
| `list` | The id of a [`<datalist>`](/en/webfrontend/<datalist>) element that provides a list of suggested values for the input
| `name` | The input's name, to identify the input in the data submitted with the form's data
| `readonly` | A Boolean attribute which, if true, indicates that the input cannot be edited
| `required` | A Boolean which, if true, indicates that the input must have a value before the form can be submitted
| `tabindex` | A numeric value providing guidance to the user agent as to the order in which controls receive focus when the user presses the Tab key
| `type` | A string indicating which input type the `<input>` element represents
| `value` | The input's current value

**`autocomplete`**

A string that describes what if any type of autocomplete functionality the input should provide.
A typical implementation of autocomplete simply recalls previous values entered in the same input
field, but more complex forms of autocomplete can exist. For instance, a browser could integrate
with a device's contacts list to autocomplete email addresses in an email input field. See
Values in The HTML autocomplete attribute for permitted values.

This attribute has no effect on input types that do not return numeric or text data,
such as `checkbox` or `image`.

See The HTML autocomplete attribute for additional information.

**`autofocus`**

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the input should automatically have focus when
the page has finished loading (or when the [`<dialog>`](/en/webfrontend/<dialog>) containing the
element has been displayed).

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: An element with the `autofocus` attribute may gain focus before the
    `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired.

No more than one element in the document may have the `autofocus` attribute, and `autofocus`
cannot be used on inputs of type `hidden`, because hidden inputs can't be focused.

!!! error ""
    Warning: Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading
    technology. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers "teleport" their user to the
    form control without warning them beforehand.

**`disabled`**

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be able to interact with
the input. Disabled inputs are typically rendered with a dimmer color or using some other form of
indication that the field is not available for use.

Specifically, disabled inputs do not receive the `click` event,
and disabled inputs are not submitted with the form.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: Although not required by the specification, Firefox will by default
    persist the dynamic disabled state of an `<input>` across page loads.
    Use the `autocomplete`(url) attribute to control this feature.

**`form`**

A string specifying the `<form>` element with which the input is associated
(that is, its **form owner**). This string's value, if present, must match the id of a `<form>`
element in the same document. If this attribute isn't specified, the `<input>` element is associated
with the nearest containing form, if any.

The `form` attribute lets you place an input anywhere in the document but have
it included with a form elsewhere in the document.

**`list`**

The `id` of a [`<datalist>`](/en/webfrontend/<datalist>) element located in the same document which
provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list
that are not compatible with the `type` are not included in the suggested options.

The `list` attribute is not supported by the `hidden`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `file`,
or any of the button types.

**`name`**

A string specifying a name for the input control. This name is submitted along with the control's
value when the form data is submitted, as well as with the owning
`<form>` element's `elements` object.

When an input element is given a `name`, that name becomes a property of the owning form element's
`HTMLFormElement.elements` property. That means if you have an input whose `name` is set to
`guest` and another whose `name` is `hat-size`, the following code can be used:

```javascript
let form = document.querySelector("form");
let guestName = form.elements.guest;
let hatSize = form.elements"hat-size"];
```

When this code has run, `guestName` will be the `HTMLInputElement` for the `guest` field,
and `hatSize` the object for the `hat-size` field.

!!! error ""
    Warning: You should avoid giving form elements a name that corresponds to a built-in property of
    the form, since you would then override the predefined property or method with this reference
    to the corresponding input.

The name `_charset_` has a special meaning. If used as the name of an `<input>` element of type
`hidden`, the input's `value` is automatically set by the user agent to the character
encoding being used to submit the form.

If no `name` is specified, or `name` is empty, the input's value is not submitted with the form.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: For historical reasons, the name `isindex` is not allowed. If you really want to know why,
    see Naming form controls: the `name` attribute in the HTML specification.

**`readonly`**

A Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user should not be
able to edit the value of the input.

The difference between `disabled` and `readonly` is that read-only controls can still function,
whereas disabled controls generally do not function as controls until they are enabled.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: The `required` attribute is not permitted on inputs with the `readonly` attribute specified.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: Only text controls can be made read-only, since for other controls
    (such as checkboxes and buttons) there is no useful distinction between being read-only and
    being disabled, so the `readonly` attribute does not apply.

**`required`**

`required` is a Boolean attribute which, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value
for the input before the owning form can be submitted. The `required` attribute is supported by
all input types except the following:

- `color`
- `hidden`
- `range`
- `submit`
- `image`
- `reset`
- `button`

hen an input has the `required` attribute, the `:required` pseudo-class also applies to it.
Conversely, inputs without the `required` attribute (except the elements that don't support it) have
the `:optional` pseudo-class applied.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: Because a read-only field cannot have a value, `required` does not have any effect on inputs
    with the `readonly` attribute also specified.

**`tabindex`**

An optional numeric value that defines both whether or not the input should be focusable through use
of the `<kbd>Tab</kbd>` key as well as whether or not the element participates in sequential focus
navigation. This value also establishes the order in which the element is
reached using the `<kbd>Tab</kbd>` key.

The values of `tabindex` have special meanings depending on sign:

- A negative value of `tabindex` indicates that the element should be focusable by the user, but not
using sequential keyboard navigation. It's recommended to always use a value
of -1 as using other values can be complicated.
- A `tabindex` of 0 means that the element should be focusable and should be reachable by sequential
keyboard navigation, but that the tab order is left up to the user agent, which should apply the
user's platform conventions. This is usually the best value to use when you want an element to be
focusable and to participate in keyboard navigation rather than trying to manage the tab order yourself.
- A positive value of `tabindex` indicates the tabbing order of the element. Each time the user
presses the `<kbd>Tab</kbd>` key, the element with the next sequentially higher `tabindex` is focused.
Most platforms provide a reverse-tab feature, typically using the combination
of `<kbd>Shift</kbd>` + `<kbd>Tab</kbd>`, which reverses the tabbing order.
If `tabindex` is omitted or is not a valid integer, the user agent follows
platform conventions to determine what to do.

**`type`**

A string specifying the type of control to render. For example, to create a checkbox, a value of
`checkbox` is used. If omitted (or an unknown value is specified), the input type `text` is used,
creating a plaintext input field.

Permitted values are listed in Form `<input>` types.

**`value`**

The input control's value. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on
it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the
respective `HTMLInputElement` object's `value` property. The `value` attribute is always optional.

!!! warn "Don't try this at home"
    Note: Unlike other input controls, checkboxes and radio buttons are only included in the submitted
    data if the `checkbox` or `radio` `button` is currently `checked`. If it is, then the `value`
    attribute is reported as the input's value.

For example, if a checkbox whose `name` is `status` has a `value` of `active`, and the checkbox is
checked, the form data submitted will include `status=active`. If the checkbox isn't active, it isn't
listed in the form data at all. The default `value` for checkboxes and radio buttons is `on`.

### Methods

The following methods are provided by the `HTMLInputElement` interface which represents
`<input>` elements in the DOM. Also available are those methods specified by the parent interfaces,
`HTMLElement`, `Element`, `Node`, and `EventTarget`.

| method | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| `checkValidity()` | Immediately runs the validity check on the element, triggering the document to fire the `invalid` event at the element if the value isn't valid. |
| `reportValidity()` | Returns `true` if the element's value passes validity checks; otherwise, returns `false`.
| `select()` | Selects the entire content of the `<input>` element, if the element's content is selectable. For elements with no selectable text content (such as a visual color picker or calendar date input), this method does nothing. |
| `setCustomValidity()` | Sets a custom message to display if the input element's value isn't valid. |
| `setRangeText()` | Sets the contents of the specified range of characters in the input element to a given string. A `selectMode` parameter is available to allow controlling how the existing content is affected. |
| `setSelectionRange()` | Selects the specified range of characters within a textual input element. Does nothing for inputs which aren't presented as text input fields. |
| `stepDown()` | Decrements the value of a numeric input by one, by default, or by the specified number of units. |
| `stepUp()` | Increments the value of a numeric input by one or by the specified number of units. |

### Styling Input Elements

You can style `<input>` elements using various color-related attributes in particular. One unusual
one that is specific to text entry-related elements is the CSS `caret-color` property,
which lets you set the color used to draw the text input caret:

```html
<label for="textInput">Note the red caret:</label>
<input id="textInput" class="custom" size="32">
```

```css
input.custom {
  caret-color: red;
  font: 16px "Helvetica", "Arial", "sans-serif";
}
```

For more information about adding color to elements in HTML,
see Applying color to HTML elements using CSS.

### Labels and Placeholders

TL;DR: To save you time, here's the key point: don't use the `placeholder` attribute if you can
avoid it. If you need to label an `<input>` element, use the [`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) element.

There are three seemingly similar ways to associate assistive text with an `<input>`. However,
they are actually quite different, and only one of them is always a good choice. Here we will look
at each of them and learn best practices for providing the user with guidance
when entering data into a form.

**The [`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) element**:

The [`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) element is the only way to provide explanatory information
about a form field that is always appropriate (aside from any layout concerns you have). It's never
a bad idea to use a [`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) to explain what should be entered into an
`<input>` or [`<textarea>`](/en/webfrontend/<textarea>).

**The placeholder attribute**:

The `placeholder` attribute lets you specify a text that appears within the `<input>`
element's content area itself when empty. It's intended to be used to show an example input,
rather than an explanation or prompt, but tends to be badly misused.

Here are two inputs that take a password, each with a placeholder:

Example of correct and incorrect placeholder usage

The first one uses a placeholder string `MyGr8P@sswrd`, demonstrating what a password might look like.
And no, that's not really a great password.

The second one uses a prompt string, `Enter your password` as a placeholder. The first, and most
obvious, problem with doing this is that as soon as the user types their first character, they no
longer have a prompt explaining what that field is for.

That's why, instead, you should use the [`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) element. The placeholder
should never be required in order to understand your forms. While some people are able to remember
what a given empty box is meant for after its only identifying text vanishes, others cannot.

If the user can't understand your form if the placeholders are missing (say, in a browser that
doesn't support placeholder, or in the case above where the user starts typing then gets confused),
you're not using placeholders properly.

In addition, browsers with automatic page translation features may skip over attributes when
translating. That means the `placeholder` may not get translated,
resulting in important information not being translated.

If you feel like you need to use a placeholder, it's possible to use both a placeholder and a label:

**Unadorned text adjacent to the `<input>` element**

You can also just have plain text adjacent to the `<input>` element, like this:

```html
<p>Enter your name: <input id="name" type="text" size="30"></p>
```

Please don't do this. This doesn't create a relationship between the prompt and the `<input>` element,
which is important for reasons we'll get into in the next section.

**Why you should use labels**:

In addition to the information provided above, there are a number of other reasons why
[`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) is the best way to explain `<input>`s:

The semantic pairing of `<input>` and [`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) elements is useful for
assistive technologies such as screen readers. By pairing them using the
[`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>)'s for attribute, you bond the label to the input in a way that
lets screen readers describe inputs to users more precisely. By pairing a
[`<label>`](/en/webfrontend/<label>) with an `<input>`, clicking on either one will focus the `<input>`.
If you use plaintext to "label" your input, this won't happen. Having the prompt part of the
activation area for the input is helpful for people with motor control conditions.
As web developers, it's important that we never assume that people will know all the things that we
know. The diversity of people using the web—and by extension your web site—practically guarantees
that some of your site's visitors will have some variation in thought processes and/or circumstances
that leads them to interpret your forms very differently from you without
clear and properly-presented labels.
